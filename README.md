# Load Board 

Welcome to the Load Board Scheduling App. This is my final project for Flatiron Bootcamp. This application allows a user to login and see assigned loads for the week as well as get directions for each load, also review and leave comments (or "notes") for the directions. This repository contains the React/Redux frontend of the project.

# Backend

The backend for this project can be found here: https://github.com/travelingwheels/Load_Board_Backend


# Installing and Starting the Load Board

Follow these steps to start up the Load Board app:

1.  Fork and clone this repository onto your own computer and run cd Load_Board_Frontend.
2.  Navigate to the backend, fork and clone that repository,run cd Load_Board_Backend. Then start the Rails server using the rails s command.
3.  From theLoad_board_Frontend directory, run npm install and npm start.

You're all set!

# Usage

Load Board is a single-page application that displays a users schedule. It also shows directions for a specific load as well as comments made by the user for the directions. The user can create, edit or delete their comments.

# Developer Notes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

These packages were also utilized in this app:

* [Redux](https://redux.js.org)

* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/wec/guides/quick-start)

* [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)

* [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org)

* [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
